What is EC2
------------------

EC2 --> Elastic Compute Cloud

It's Virtual server that you rent in AWS

Provides secure,resizable compute capacity in the cloud

Why EC2
-----------------

-->Easy to scale 
-->Reliable
-->User with Other services
-->Only pay for what you use

pricing for EC2
------------------

=> Free Tier
=> On-Demand Instances -a virtual server that you can purchase and use as needed, without committing to long-term use or making upfront payments
=> Savings plans  -  provide savings beyond On-Demand rates in exchange for a commitment of using a specified amount of compute power (measured per hour) for a one or three year period.
=> Reserved instances - a billing discount that you receive for committing to use a specific instance type for a set period of time
=> Spot Instances - a way to access unused Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) capacity at a reduced cost 
=> Dedicated Hosts -  a physical server that is entirely dedicated to a single customer's use
=> Pre-second billing - bills Amazon EC2 instances in one-second increments, with a minimum of 60 seconds. its depands on OS

EC2 Instance
---------------------

EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to run applications on the public cloud.

EC2 Instance types
--------------------
On-Demand Instances

--> Pay for compute capacity by per hour or per second.
--> No longer-term commitments or upfront payments are needed.
--> Users that prefer the low cost and flexibility of amazom EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
--> Applications with short-term, spiky,or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
--> Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.


Reserved Instances

--> Reserved Instances provide you with a sinificant discount(up to 75%) compareed to On-Demand instance pricing.

--> Application with steady state usage
--> Application that may require reserved capacity
--> Customers that can commit to using EC2 over a 1 or 3 years term to reduce their total computing costs

Spot Instances

--> Amazon EC2 Spot instances allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off the On-Demand price.
--> Spot Advisor
--> Pricing History

--> Application that have flexible start and end times 
--> Application that are only feasible at very low compute prices
--> Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

Amazon Machine Images in Amazon EC2

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a virtual image that provides the information needed to launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance

What it is
---------------

An AMI is a template that contains the software, operating system, and other applications required to set up and boot an EC2 instance. 


What it does
---------------

AMIs are used to create virtual servers, or EC2 instances, in the AWS environment. You can launch as many instances from as many different AMIs as you need.
 
How it works
---------------

When you launch an instance, you must specify an AMI. The AMI includes a block device mapping that specifies which block devices to attach to the instance. 


AMIs are categorized by: 
-----------------------------

--> Region 
--> Operating system 
--> System architecture (32- or 64-bit) 
--> Launch permissions
--> Root device  type
--> virtualization type 

Region
--------

A region is a geographic area that is separate from other regions.

Operating System
------------------
-linux
-unix
-windows

System Architecture
-------------------
AMI Architecture will either be 32-bit or 64-bit.

launch permissions
-------------------

- public
- explicit
- implicit

Root Device type
------------------

-Amazon EBS-backed AMI - Snapshot
-Amazon instance store-backed AMI - S3

Virtualization type
--------------------
-HVM

-PV

Steps to Create EC2 instance
---------------------------------
==> Choose an Amazon Machine Image(AMI)
==> Choose an Instance Type
==> Configure instance Details
==> Add Storage
==> Add Tags
==> Configure Security Group
==> Review Instance Launch

Steps to Create AMI
--------------------------
1. Configure an EC2 instance and its attached EBS volumes
2. Log in to the AWS Management Console
3. Click Instances
4. Choose the instance from which you want to create a custom AMI
5. Click Actions and click Create Image
6. Type a name for Image Name
7. (Optional) Enter a description for your image
8. Click Create Image

Why We Should Create AMI

AMIs allow you to pre-install any required packages on an EC2 instance, 
improve boot time, implement security controls for all instances simultaneously, 
and launch production-ready instances quickly when needed.

Benefits
-----------

=> Faster Setup
=> Preconfigured Template
=> Flexibility
=> Cost reduction
=> Backup and recovery
=> Sparate Environment



Snapshot
------------
In Amazon Web Services (AWS), a snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an Amazon EBS volume that's used for data protection and backup

Benefits
----------

=> Data Protection
=> Disaster Recovery
=> Cost efficiency
=> Flexibility
=> Data backup

Steps to Create Snapshots
-------------------------------
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console 
2. Go to Services, then Compute, then EC2 
3. Select the EBS volume 
4. Go to Actions, then Create Snapshot 
5. Enter a description, encryption settings, and tags 
6. Click Create Snapshot


Ec2 Global View - To View Status of all Servers.

Events - Creating events in Amazon EC2 instances can help ensure that your instances are running at optimal performance levels and minimize downtime
         - if one instance is deleted or terminated then event will create 10 instance of that deleted instance
Lounch Template - An EC2 launch template stores configuration information for launching instances, 
                  which allows you to avoid specifying the same parameters each time you launch an instance
